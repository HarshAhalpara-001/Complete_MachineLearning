# Using Pipelines in Scikit-Learn

In `scikit-learn`, a **Pipeline** allows you to automate the process of data transformation and model training. It ensures all steps are applied consistently, making your workflow efficient and reproducible. Below is an overview of components you can include in a pipeline:

## 1. Preprocessing/Transformation Steps

These steps transform the data before it is passed to the model. Examples include:

- **Scaling/Normalization**:
  - `StandardScaler()`: Standardizes features by removing the mean and scaling to unit variance.
  - `MinMaxScaler()`: Scales each feature to a given range (usually 0 to 1).

- **Imputation** (Handling Missing Values):
  - `SimpleImputer()`: Replaces missing values with the mean, median, mode, or a constant value.

- **Encoding**:
  - `OneHotEncoder()`: Converts categorical variables into one-hot encoded features.
  - `OrdinalEncoder()`: Encodes categorical features as integers.

- **Polynomial Features**:
  - `PolynomialFeatures()`: Generates polynomial and interaction features.

- **Dimensionality Reduction**:
  - `PCA()`: Principal Component Analysis for reducing the dimensionality of the dataset.
  - `SelectKBest()`: Selects the top `k` features based on statistical tests.

## 2. Feature Engineering Steps

These include steps that create or modify features:

- **Binarization**:
  - `Binarizer()`: Converts numerical features into binary values based on a threshold.

- **Discretization**:
  - `KBinsDiscretizer()`: Converts continuous features into discrete bins.

- **Interaction Features**:
  - You can create interaction terms or polynomial terms using custom transformers or prebuilt options like `PolynomialFeatures()`.

## 3. Model Selection/Estimation Steps

These are the models or estimators you want to fit on the transformed data:

- **Regression Models**:
  - `LinearRegression()`, `Ridge()`, `Lasso()`, `ElasticNet()`, etc.
  - `SVR()`: Support Vector Regression.
  - `DecisionTreeRegressor()`, `RandomForestRegressor()`, `GradientBoostingRegressor()`.

- **Classification Models**:
  - `LogisticRegression()`, `SVC()`: Support Vector Classification.
  - `DecisionTreeClassifier()`, `RandomForestClassifier()`, `GradientBoostingClassifier()`.

- **Clustering**:
  - `KMeans()`, `DBSCAN()`, `AgglomerativeClustering()`.

- **Custom Models**:
  - You can also use custom models or custom estimators that you build.

## 4. Dimensionality Reduction and Feature Selection Steps

- **Dimensionality Reduction**:
  - `PCA()`: Principal Component Analysis.
  - `TruncatedSVD()`: Singular Value Decomposition for dimensionality reduction.

- **Feature Selection**:
  - `SelectKBest()`: Selects the `k` highest scoring features.
  - `RFE()`: Recursive Feature Elimination for feature ranking and selection.
  - `VarianceThreshold()`: Removes features with low variance.

## 5. Custom Transformers

You can create your own transformers by subclassing `TransformerMixin` and `BaseEstimator` to add any kind of transformation or feature engineering you need:

```python
from sklearn.base import TransformerMixin, BaseEstimator

class CustomTransformer(TransformerMixin, BaseEstimator):
    def fit(self, X, y=None):
        # Learn from the data (if needed)
        return self

    def transform(self, X):
        # Apply a transformation
        return X_transformed
