# Logistic Regression - Working Explained

Logistic Regression is a classification algorithm used in machine learning to predict the probability of a target variable belonging to a specific class. It is particularly useful when the target variable is binary (e.g., 0 or 1) but can also be extended to multiclass classification using approaches like multinomial or one-vs-rest.

### 1. **Basic Idea**

The basic idea behind logistic regression is to find a linear relationship between the features (input variables) and the log-odds of the target variable. The log-odds, also known as the logit function, is the natural logarithm of the odds ratio. Logistic Regression then applies the **logistic function** (also known as the sigmoid function) to map these log-odds to probabilities that lie between 0 and 1.

The logistic function is defined as:

\[
P(y=1|X) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-z}}
\]

where:

- \( P(y=1|X) \) is the probability that the target variable \( y \) is 1 given input features \( X \).
- \( z \) is the linear combination of the input features, given by:

\[
z = w_0 + w_1x_1 + w_2x_2 + \ldots + w_nx_n
\]

Here, \( w_0 \) is the intercept (bias), and \( w_1, w_2, \ldots, w_n \) are the weights (coefficients) corresponding to each feature \( x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n \).

### 2. **Training the Model**

During training, logistic regression finds the best coefficients \( w \) that minimize the loss function (in this case, the **log-loss** or **cross-entropy loss**). The loss function measures how well the model's predicted probabilities match the actual target values.

The loss function for logistic regression is:

\[
J(w) = -\frac{1}{m} \sum_{i=1}^{m} [y_i \log(\hat{y}_i) + (1 - y_i) \log(1 - \hat{y}_i)]
\]

where:

- \( m \) is the number of training samples.
- \( y_i \) is the actual label for the \( i \)-th sample.
- \( \hat{y}_i \) is the predicted probability for the \( i \)-th sample.

The optimization algorithm, such as **Gradient Descent** or **Stochastic Gradient Descent**, adjusts the weights to minimize this loss function.

### 3. **Multiclass Classification**

Logistic Regression can be extended to handle multiclass classification problems using:

- **One-vs-Rest (OvR)**: This method fits a separate logistic regression model for each class, treating the class as "positive" and all others as "negative." The class with the highest probability is chosen as the prediction.
- **Multinomial**: This method directly fits a logistic regression model for multiple classes simultaneously using a generalization of the log-loss function. This is a more efficient and natural approach for multiclass problems.

### 4. **Parameters Explained**

Here's a breakdown of the parameters used in the logistic regression model:

- **`fit_intercept=True`**: This adds an intercept term (bias) in the model.
- **`multi_class='multinomial'`**: Specifies how to handle multiclass classification. Options include:
  - `'auto'`: Automatically selects the best option based on the data and solver.
  - `'ovr'` (One-vs-Rest): Fits separate binary classifiers for each class.
  - `'multinomial'`: Fits the model for multiple classes directly (more efficient for multiclass problems).
- **`penalty='l2'`**: This applies **L2 regularization** (Ridge regression), which penalizes large coefficients to prevent overfitting.
- **`solver='saga'`**: The optimization algorithm used. SAGA is suitable for large datasets and supports both L1 and L2 regularization.
- **`max_iter=10000`**: The maximum number of iterations for the solver to converge. A high value ensures that the solver has enough time to find the optimal solution.
- **`C=50`**: This is the inverse of the regularization strength. A smaller value indicates stronger regularization, and a larger value indicates weaker regularization. Here, a value of 50 implies a moderate amount of regularization.

### 5. **Model Evaluation**

After fitting the model, it's important to evaluate its performance using metrics such as **accuracy**, **precision**, **recall**, and **confusion matrix**. In our code:

```python
from sklearn.metrics import confusion_matrix, accuracy_score
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

cm = confusion_matrix(y_test, model.predict(X_test))
print(accuracy_score(y_test, model.predict(X_test)))

plt.figure(figsize=(8, 6))
sns.heatmap(cm, annot=True, fmt='d', cmap='Blues', linewidths=0.5)
plt.xlabel('Predicted labels')
plt.ylabel('True labels')
plt.title('Confusion Matrix')
plt.show()
```

- **Confusion Matrix**: It shows the counts of actual vs. predicted labels, helping to visualize the performance of the classifier.
- **Accuracy**: The proportion of correctly predicted instances out of the total instances.

In our example, we achieved an accuracy of approximately **97.2%**, indicating that our model is performing well on the test data.
