Naive Bayes is a family of probabilistic algorithms based on applying Bayes' theorem with strong (naive) independence assumptions between the features. There are several types of Naive Bayes classifiers, each suited to different types of data. Here are the main types:

### 1. Gaussian Naive Bayes

- **Use Case**: This type is used when the features are continuous and are assumed to be normally distributed (Gaussian distribution).
- **Assumption**: The likelihood of the features is calculated using the mean and variance of the features.
- **Formula**: 
  \[
  P(x | y) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi \sigma^2}} e^{-\frac{(x - \mu)^2}{2\sigma^2}}
  \]
  where \( \mu \) is the mean and \( \sigma^2 \) is the variance of the feature for class \( y \).

### 2. Multinomial Naive Bayes

- **Use Case**: This type is used for discrete count data, such as text classification (e.g., spam detection).
- **Assumption**: It assumes that the features are multinomially distributed, meaning that the features represent counts or frequencies of events (e.g., word counts).
- **Formula**:
  \[
  P(x | y) = \frac{(N!) }{(n_1! n_2! ... n_k!)} \cdot \prod_{j=1}^{k} p_j^{n_j}
  \]
  where \( N \) is the total number of occurrences, \( n_j \) is the count of feature \( j \), and \( p_j \) is the probability of feature \( j \) given class \( y \).

### 3. Bernoulli Naive Bayes

- **Use Case**: This type is similar to the Multinomial Naive Bayes but is specifically used for binary/boolean features (e.g., presence or absence of a feature).
- **Assumption**: It assumes that each feature is a binary indicator (0 or 1) and models the occurrence or non-occurrence of features.
- **Formula**:
  \[
  P(x | y) = \prod_{j=1}^{n} p_j^{x_j} (1 - p_j)^{(1 - x_j)}
  \]
  where \( x_j \) indicates the presence (1) or absence (0) of feature \( j \).

### 4. Complement Naive Bayes

- **Use Case**: This variant is an adaptation of the Multinomial Naive Bayes, designed to improve the performance of the classifier on imbalanced datasets.
- **Assumption**: It calculates the probability of each class using the complement of the class to better handle classes with fewer instances.
- **Formula**: Similar to Multinomial Naive Bayes, but it uses the complementary counts of the features across all classes to compute probabilities.

### Summary of Differences

| Type                     | Data Type                | Assumption                             |
|--------------------------|--------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Gaussian Naive Bayes     | Continuous               | Features follow a Gaussian distribution |
| Multinomial Naive Bayes  | Count data               | Features follow a multinomial distribution |
| Bernoulli Naive Bayes    | Binary/Boolean           | Features are binary indicators          |
| Complement Naive Bayes    | Count data               | Based on complementary counts for imbalanced classes |

Each type of Naive Bayes classifier has strengths and weaknesses, so it is essential to choose the appropriate one based on the nature of the data and the specific problem being solved.
