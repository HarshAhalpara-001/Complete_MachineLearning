# Linear Regression: Normal Equation vs. Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)

## Introduction

This notebook explores the implementation of linear regression using two primary methods: the Normal Equation and Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD). We will use the California housing dataset to demonstrate both approaches and compare their performances.

## Dataset Overview

We will use the California housing dataset fetched from `sklearn`. The dataset contains various features related to housing prices in California. Hereâ€™s a quick overview:

| Feature      | Description                                          |
|--------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| MedInc      | Median income in block group                          |
| HouseAge    | Median age of houses in block group                   |
| AveRooms    | Average number of rooms per household                 |
| AveBedrms   | Average number of bedrooms per household               |
| Population   | Block group population                                 |
| AveOccup    | Average household size                                 |
| Latitude    | Latitude of the block group                           |
| Longitude   | Longitude of the block group                          |
| Target      | Median house value                                    |

## Data Preprocessing

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
from sklearn.datasets import fetch_california_housing
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler

# Load the dataset
housing = fetch_california_housing()
housing_df = pd.DataFrame(data=housing.data, columns=housing.feature_names)
housing_df['target'] = housing.target

# Display the first few rows
housing_df.head()
```

## Correlation Matrix

To understand the relationships between features and the target variable, we visualize the correlation matrix.

```python
corr_matrix = housing_df.corr()
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 8))
sns.heatmap(corr_matrix, annot=True, cmap='coolwarm')
plt.show()
```

## Data Splitting

We split the data into training and testing sets:

```python
X = housing_df[['MedInc', 'HouseAge', 'AveRooms', 'AveBedrms', 'Population', 'AveOccup', 'Latitude', 'Longitude']]
y = housing_df.target
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
```

## Scaling Features

Scaling the features is essential for gradient descent methods to ensure they converge efficiently:

```python
scaler = StandardScaler()
X_train_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(X_train)
X_test_scaled = scaler.transform(X_test)
```

## Linear Regression using Normal Equation

We will implement linear regression using the Normal Equation:

```python
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error

# Create and fit the model
model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X_train_scaled, y_train)

# Evaluation
print('MSE:', mean_squared_error(y_test, model.predict(X_test_scaled)))
print('R2 score on Train:', model.score(X_train_scaled, y_train))
print('R2 score on Test:', model.score(X_test_scaled, y_test))
```

### Results

- **MSE:** [MSE value]
- **R2 score on Train:** [R2 Train score]
- **R2 score on Test:** [R2 Test score]

## Linear Regression using Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)

Now we will implement linear regression using SGD:

```python
from sklearn.linear_model import SGDRegressor

# Create and fit the model
sgd_regressor = SGDRegressor(max_iter=1000, tol=1e-3, alpha=0.01, penalty='l2', random_state=42)
sgd_regressor.fit(X_train_scaled, y_train)

# Evaluation
print('MSE:', mean_squared_error(y_test, sgd_regressor.predict(X_test_scaled)))
print('R2 score on Train:', sgd_regressor.score(X_train_scaled, y_train))
print('R2 score on Test:', sgd_regressor.score(X_test_scaled, y_test))
```

### Results

- **MSE:** [MSE value]
- **R2 score on Train:** [R2 Train score]
- **R2 score on Test:** [R2 Test score]

## Comparison of Methods

| Metric                  | Normal Equation      | Stochastic Gradient Descent |
|-------------------------|----------------------|-----------------------------|
| MSE                     | 0.5558915986952442   | 0.5498444775439945          |
| R2 Score (Train)       | 0.6125511913966952   | 0.6096034335419529          |
| R2 Score (Test)        | 0.575787706032451    | 0.580402388358092           |


## Conclusion

In this notebook, we compared the performance of linear regression using the Normal Equation and Stochastic Gradient Descent. The results indicate that while both methods can effectively model the data, their performance can vary based on the specific characteristics of the dataset. 

In general, for large datasets or high-dimensional data, SGD tends to be more efficient and scalable than the Normal Equation.
